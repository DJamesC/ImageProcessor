# ImageProcessor

## Set Up
* Download this repository
* Add images files to the solutions 'ImageProcessor/ProductImages' folder (images not included due to size)
* Image files can be downloaded here - https://www.masterofmalt.com/external_resources/dev_interview/product_images.zip


## Use
Run the application, this will display a simple UI allowing for user entered values for requested parameters.
While running the web app with the console visible, you can see examples of logging for missing files (Missing file name included in the dropdown for test/demo purposes "XDemoMissingImage") or also unsupported file types (such as "foo")

## Notes
There are some areas that I would improve if I were to spend more time on this project, some examples of this would be UI input validation and improved logging (I've included some for demonstration purposes)
I set out with the intention of supporting docker, however as this is not a standalone application and needs to access a file system there were a number of hurdles that this presented me and so I decided not to pursue this further. I would be happy to discuss how I believe I would solve these issues along with other ideas and improvements I'd like to include if I were to spend more time on this project.
